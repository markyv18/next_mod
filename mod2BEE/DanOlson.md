Dear New Mod 2 Students,

  You are about to embark on an exciting adventure in creating web apps that are connected to a database.
  You will now be able see and touch your programs in a much different way than you are used to in mod 1. This
  mod has been absolutely amazing. Some things you should focus on during your journey. 
  
  1. Rspec: Writting "good" tests was the hardest thing for me to make work. I would focus heavily on this skill because
    if you write good tests your code will basically write it self when you follow the errors. Be comfortable with using css
    selectors on your html views to better select things on the page. (I had a lot of success using the -within- method on my tests)
    
  2. Do the homework!!! There is a lot of repetition in the exercises and you must do them. It will make you SO much better.
  
  3. Ask questions!!! There are several checkins after you have completed an assignment. Get your questions answered right away!
  
  4. ActiveRecord: The basics you will learn but if you want to get to the next level, learn how to chain AR methods together.
  
  5. Documents are your friend(most of them). Be comfortable not knowing the answer and going deep on something. Several times I got stuck
     and had to research the answer. Dont expect to go to the instructor without telling them what you HAVE done. If you go with
     just a question they will tell you to look first.
     
 I'm confident you will all enjoy this mod and look forward to seeing your creations. Good luck!!!
