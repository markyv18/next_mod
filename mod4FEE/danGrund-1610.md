keep your head down and buckle up. Try not to divide your attention between too many different projects! it'll make everything much more difficult. 
do go to meetups if you can. and don't just go, talk to as many people that you don't know as you can. ask questions. 
remember you know how to do this. it's not hard. everything on the internet is basically a crud app. you've got this.
