### Don't Panic

+ Right now you know very little in comparison to almost everyone else in the building. That's nothing to worry about. It is actually an asset, because is means that you can grab almost anyone, and they will know how to answer your questions.
+ Get over your ego. You might not be used to struggling or asking for help. Don't be embarassed about asking about something you don't understand. People like to help. People want to help. People will not think you are dumb for asking.
+ If you can't figure something out on your own after 20 minutes or so, it is time to start looking for help. Brute forcing your way through a problem isn't efficient. You are here to learn, not frustrate yourself.
+ If you are trying to make the choice bewtwen an extra hour of sleep, or an extra hour of coding. Go to sleep. Take care of yourself.
+ Learn to use your computer like a developer. Get in the habit early of knowing shortcuts, customizing your terminal, not using the mouse. Etc. Every upper mod student thinks that their terminal customizations are way better than anyone elses. This is false, my terminal is objectively and subjectively the best.

+ Functionality is only one part of the evaluation rubric. The rest of the categories matter too. Re-read this after a week or two at Turing.
+ There is no such thing as being the best at coding. Effective coding is a full package, including technical abilities, communication, social skills and more. Coding is a team sport.
+ You will start most projects without knowing the skills you need to finish them. That's fine
+ Our cohort bonded because we made an effort to build relationships in and outside of Turing (happy hour!). You are going to spend a LOT of time with your cohort, they may as well be your friends.
+ A lot of these advice pieces from the upper mods sound scary. Don't feel overwhelmed. Each day taken on its own is very manageable, and you'll be fine. Really.
