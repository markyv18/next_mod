Welcome to Mod 3. You're about to feel very tired. The good news is that you're about to learn some of the most important
skills. When you're tired, make sure you remember why you're here. Think about your personal project now so that you can start
falling in love with it now. Ask for help often. Come find me and I will either help or not know with you. Don't push your API
keys.

As always, may the Force be with you.
Katy
