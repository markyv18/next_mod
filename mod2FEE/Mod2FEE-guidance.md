# MOD2 FE Guidance
* when in doubt, whiteboard it- valuable way to work through ideas
* try iron-FE, worthwhile for a lot of folks, worthwhile even just to spectate
* practice react early
* look out for your neighbor, help each other as a community
* don't be afraid to ask for a pom,  everyone else is thinking the same thing
* your mod appreciates snacks
* if you question, there's a 99% chance that the person next to you has the same question
* trust the process,  you're building foundations that will continue to serve you
* hang out with a diversity of people, the different views/knowledge benefit all involved
* pair with previous mod, helps everyone
* seek balance, it's ok to take a weekend off
* don't panic about the next project, focus on the 'now', the next thing will always be intimidating but you'll get through it
* embrace the community,  posses, spikes and speakers provide some balance and provide insights and a break from direct coding
* a mentor is invaluable, get one soon
* don't be afraid to get guidance from other mods, front end AND back end
* tests are great, embrace TDD
* volunteering at a Try Turing event is a good way to engage with the community
* bring layers... the classroom is cold
